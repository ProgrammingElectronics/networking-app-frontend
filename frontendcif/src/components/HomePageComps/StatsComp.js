            <p>Course Report is pleased to present our seventh annual Market Sizing Report, another in-depth, empirical study that takes stock of the coding bootcamp industry each year. Course Report polled every full-time, in-person US/Canadian bootcamp with courses in web and mobile development, gathering statistics on 2019 graduates and projected 2020 graduation rates.

            This year marks the 8th anniversary for the coding bootcamp industry, and the number of coding bootcamp graduates continues to grow since the first bootcamps launched in 2012. Coding bootcamps are a $350 million industry and will graduate ~25,000 developers in 2020. </p>
